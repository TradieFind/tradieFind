### Version
1.0.0

### Tech

TradieFind 1.0.0 uses a number of frameworks as listed below:

* [Backbonejs] - is a JavaScript framework with a RESTful JSON interface and is based on the model–view–presenter (MVP) application design paradigm.
* [Underscore] - Underscore is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects.
* [Ruby on Rails] - Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.
* [Twitter Boostrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Google Map Api] - The Google Maps APIs give developers several ways of embedding Google Maps into web pages or retrieving data from Google Maps, and allow for either simple use or extensive customization.
* [YouTube] - An online streaming video player
* [JQuery] - a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.


And of course TradieFind itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
